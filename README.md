Hello world.

I'm learning web development through odin-project and this assignment was to recreate the google homepage.

The first iteration I attempted to code it without reference to see where my knowledge gaps were and found I couldn't get the positioning of the <div> elements quite right, couldn't get the form and buttons positioned/formatted properly. However, I understood the main elements of the page (two nav bars, logo + text and a search form)

I scrapped the CSS and started again but with w3schools open as reference so that I understood the options with each element. Had a much easier time getting things to work, getting my workflow in place by working on each element one by one.

Obviously there are still many imperfections but I feel like I've learnt enough to continue on the course and try out some new stuff.
